# 🧠 Daily Dev Practice

Welcome to my daily development practice repository — my personal space to code every day, strengthen problem-solving skills, and document my learning journey.

Here, you’ll find solutions to coding challenges (especially LeetCode), Python experiments, and notes from various courses and projects. This is my evolving developer journal.🌱

## 📌 Goals

- 🗓️ Build and maintain **daily coding consistency**
- 💡 Improve **problem-solving** and **algorithmic thinking**
- 📚 Reinforce understanding of **core CS concepts**
- ✍️ Document what I learn from **courses, books, or projects**
- 🚀 Track personal growth and coding progress over time
